NIX Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
NIX Core is the original NIX client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of NIX transactions (which is currently more than 100 GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download NIX Core, visit [nixcore.org](https://nixcore.org/en/releases/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run NIX on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/nix-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/nixd` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run nix-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag NIX-Core to your applications folder, and then run NIX-Core.

### Need Help?

* See the documentation at the [NIX Wiki](https://en.nix.it/wiki/Main_Page)
for help and more information.
* Ask for help on [#nix](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=nix) on Freenode. If you don't have an IRC client use [webchat here](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=nix).
* Ask for help on the [NIXTalk](https://nixtalk.org/) forums, in the [Technical Support board](https://nixtalk.org/index.php?board=4.0).
